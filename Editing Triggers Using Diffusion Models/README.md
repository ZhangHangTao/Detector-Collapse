In our physical parts, we used dynamic triggers, which were edited using Stable Diffusion. This is entirely based on the excellent work at [Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example](https://github.com/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example). The corresponding folder, **Editing Triggers Using Diffusion Models**, provides an example of editing a basketball trigger, which can be run using `sh test.sh`. You are free to use natural objects as dynamic triggers for your backdoors. Additionally, we have noted some excellent works that also use dynamic triggers, such as the **Versatile Backdoor Attack with Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible Triggers**. Check it out here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00816](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00816).
