In our physical experiments, we used dynamic triggers, which were edited using Stable Diffusion. This is entirely based on the excellent work at [Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example](https://github.com/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example). The corresponding folder, **Editing Triggers Using Diffusion Models**, provides an example of editing a basketball trigger, which can be run using `sh test.sh`.
