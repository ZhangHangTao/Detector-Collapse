In our physical parts, we used dynamic triggers, which were edited using Stable Diffusion. This is entirely based on the excellent work at [Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example](https://github.com/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example). The corresponding folder, **Editing Triggers Using Diffusion Models**, provides an example of editing a basketball trigger, which can be run using `sh test.sh`. You are free to use natural objects as dynamic triggers for your backdoors. Additionally, we have noted some excellent works that also use dynamic triggers created with diffusion models, such as the *"Versatile Backdoor Attack with Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible Triggers"*. Check it out here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00816](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00816).
